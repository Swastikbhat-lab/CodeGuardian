                ##  Why it's a risk:
Without the specific vulnerability details, common high-severity risks in agent utilities include command injection, path traversal, or unsafe deserialization that could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive files. These vulnerabilities can lead to complete system compromise, especially in agent software that often runs with elevated privileges.

                ###  Why it's a risk:
High cyclomatic complexity (31) indicates the `run_tests_and_get_coverage` function has too many decision paths, making it extremely difficult to test thoroughly and maintain. This creates security risks because complex code is more prone to bugs, edge cases, and logical errors that could be exploited. The function likely handles multiple responsibilities, increasing the chance of introducing vulnerabilities during modifications.

- Replace nested if/else with early returns

                ## 
High cyclomatic complexity (13) indicates too many branching paths and decision points in the `read_system_prompt` function, making it difficult to test thoroughly and maintain. This increases the likelihood of unhandled edge cases and bugs, and makes security reviews challenging since all execution paths are harder to trace and verify.

                <strong>⚠️ Why it's a risk:</strong><br>
                ## Why it's a risk:
High cyclomatic complexity makes code difficult to understand, test, and maintain, increasing the likelihood of introducing bugs or security vulnerabilities. Complex functions with many decision paths are harder to review thoroughly, making it easier for malicious code or logic errors to hide within the complexity.

                <strong>⚠️ Why it's a risk:</strong><br>
                ### Why it's a risk:
Deep nesting makes code extremely difficult to read, test, and maintain, significantly increasing the likelihood of introducing bugs and security vulnerabilities. Complex nested logic is harder to reason about during security reviews and more prone to edge cases that could be exploited. It also makes the code brittle and difficult to modify safely.

                ## Why it's a risk:
High cyclomatic complexity (44) makes the `main` function extremely difficult to test, debug, and maintain, significantly increasing the likelihood of introducing bugs and security vulnerabilities. Complex functions with many decision paths are harder to reason about and more prone to logical errors that could lead to unexpected behavior or security flaws.
